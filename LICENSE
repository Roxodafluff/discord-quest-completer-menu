### ✅ Tips for Adding GIFs / Screenshots:

1. Take screenshots of the menu in **Discord Desktop**.  
2. Record a GIF showing:  
   - Starting a quest  
   - Status log updating  
   - Estimated time countdown  
   - Minimizing and closing the menu  
3. Upload images/GIFs to **GitHub, Imgur, or any static hosting** and replace the links in the README (`https://your-image-link.com/...`).

If you want, I can **even make a ready-to-use GIF mockup of the menu in action** with the buttons, minimizing, and progress log — so you just have to add it to your GitHub README.  

Do you want me to do that?
